## Exercises and practical

### General

### Usage
You find exercises in the `exercises` folder, and mini-projects in the
`mini-projects` folder. When you are adding code to this repository, this code
lives exclusively in the `your-code` folder.

When working on the exercises or mini-projects in groups, create a folder with
your group name, e.g., `group1`, in the `your-code` folder.
